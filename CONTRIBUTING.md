├── setup.html          # Setup/onboarding page
├── styles.css          # All styles

### Key Components

1. **PolymarketAPI** (api.js)
   - Fetches markets from CLOB API
   - Calculates volatility
   - Caches responses

2. **GroqAPI** (api.js)
   - Gets AI predictions
   - Handles API key storage
   - Fallback to mock predictions

3. **PriceSimulator** (api.js)
   - Simulates real-time price movement
   - Different volatility levels
   - Random walk with trends

4. **PolymarketTradingGame** (game.js)
   - Main game controller
   - Session management
   - Trade execution
   - UI updates

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Start Session"
    ↓
Fetch markets from Polymarket API
    ↓
Get AI predictions for each market
    ↓
Filter markets by AI threshold (≥75%)
    ↓
Display market cards (colored by volatility)
    ↓
User clicks market → Enter trade
    ↓
Start timer & price simulation
    ↓
User clicks "Sell Now" → Exit trade
    ↓
Update P&L and session stats
    ↓
Session ends → Show report
```

## 🎨 Coding Style

### JavaScript

```javascript
// Use camelCase for variables and functions
const marketData = fetchMarkets();
function calculatePnL(trade) { ... }

// Use PascalCase for classes
class PolymarketAPI { ... }

// Use UPPERCASE for constants
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';

// Prefer async/await over promises
async function loadData() {
    const data = await fetch(url);
    return data.json();
}

// Add JSDoc comments for functions
/**
 * Calculate profit/loss for a trade
 * @param {Object} trade - Trade object
 * @returns {number} P&L in dollars
 */
function calculatePnL(trade) { ... }
```

### CSS

```css
/* Use BEM-like naming */
.market-card { }
.market-card__title { }
.market-card--active { }

/* Group related styles */
/* Header */
.header { }
.header-stats { }

/* Market Grid */
.market-grid { }
.market-card { }
```

### HTML

```html
<!-- Use semantic HTML -->
<header>
<main>
<section>

<!-- Add ARIA labels for accessibility -->
<button aria-label="Start new session">Start</button>

<!-- Use data attributes for JS hooks -->
<div data-market-id="123">...</div>
```

## 🐛 Common Issues

### CORS Errors

- Polymarket API supports CORS
- Groq API supports CORS
- If testing locally, use a local server (not file://)

### API Rate Limits

- Groq free tier: 30 requests/minute
- Add delays between batch predictions
- Implement exponential backoff for retries

### LocalStorage Not Working

- Check browser privacy settings
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
- Test in incognito mode
