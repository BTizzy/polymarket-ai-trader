## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone & Build

```bash
# You're in the kraken-cpp-bot branch
git checkout kraken-cpp-bot

cd bot
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

### 2. Set API Keys

```bash
# Create .env file (DO NOT COMMIT)
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your Kraken API credentials
# KRAKEN_API_KEY="your_key"
# KRAKEN_API_SECRET="your_secret"
# KRAKEN_PAPER_MODE="true"  (for paper trading)

source .env
```

### 3. Run in Paper Mode (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
./kraken_bot
```

Watch it:
- Scan Kraken pairs for opportunities
- Execute micro trades (paper money)
- Analyze every 25 trades
- Learn and improve strategies
- Print detailed analysis

### 4. After 50+ Trades (with 55%+ win rate)

```bash
./kraken_bot --live
```

Type `YES` to go live with real money.

## 🧠 50x More Robust Learning - What This Means

### The Problem with Naive Learning

❌ Old approach:
```
"BTC is profitable 60% of the time - let's trade it"
```

✅ Our approach:
```
"BTC/USD at 2x leverage on 60-second holds = 62% win rate (47 trades, 78% confidence, 1.85 P/F)"
"BTC/USD at 5x leverage on 30-second holds = 45% win rate (12 trades, 35% confidence, 0.88 P/F)"
"BTC/USD at 1x leverage on 120-second holds = 58% win rate (31 trades, 72% confidence, 1.52 P/F)"
```

### The 50x Improvement

1. **Dimensions**: From 1D (pair) to 5D (pair + leverage + timeframe + volatility + spread)
2. **Statistics**: Raw win rates → Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, profit factor, max drawdown
3. **Confidence**: Every pattern gets a confidence score (0-1)
4. **Correlation**: Finds synergies between different patterns
5. **Regime**: Detects market shifts and adapts
6. **Outliers**: Removes lucky outliers to avoid over-fitting
7. **Evolution**: Database tracks strategy performance over time
8. **Ensemble**: Combines multiple strategies for robustness

## 📊 Learning Cycle Example

After 25 trades, the bot automatically analyzes:

```
🤖 LEARNING ENGINE: Analyzing 25 trades...
  📈 BTC/USD_2x_1 | Trades: 8 | Win Rate: 62.5% | P/F: 1.92 | Sharpe: 2.1 | Conf: 78% ✅
  📈 ETH/USD_1x_2 | Trades: 12 | Win Rate: 58.3% | P/F: 1.65 | Sharpe: 1.8 | Conf: 65% ✅
  📈 SOL/USD_5x_0 | Trades: 5 | Win Rate: 40.0% | P/F: 0.88 | Sharpe: -0.5 | Conf: 35% ❌

🏆 WINNING PATTERNS:
  #1: BTC/USD_2x_1 | PF: 1.92 | WR: 62.5% | Trades: 8
  #2: ETH/USD_1x_2 | PF: 1.65 | WR: 58.3% | Trades: 12

🔗 PATTERN CORRELATIONS:
  BTC/USD_2x_1 <-> ETH/USD_1x_2: 0.45 (positive - win together)
  BTC/USD_2x_1 <-> SOL/USD_5x_0: -0.12 (negative - conflict)

📊 REGIME ANALYSIS:
  Old period win rate: 56%
  Recent period win rate: 61%
  ✅ Improving trend detected

🔄 UPDATING STRATEGY DATABASE...
  ✅ Created 2 validated strategies
```

Next 25 trades will use these learned strategies!

## 🎯 Key Metrics

The bot tracks:

| Metric | Purpose | Threshold |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Win Rate** | % of profitable trades | > 45% |
| **Profit Factor** | Gross wins / gross losses | > 1.0 |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted returns | > 0.5 |
| **Sortino Ratio** | Downside-only risk | > 0.3 |
| **Max Drawdown** | Worst peak-to-trough loss | < 30% |
| **Confidence** | Statistical certainty | > 60% |
| **Edge** | Expected profit % per trade | > fees (0.4%) |

Patterns that fall below thresholds are **automatically disabled**.

---

## 🛡️ Security

✅ **API Keys from Environment Variables**
```bash
export KRAKEN_API_KEY="..."
export KRAKEN_API_SECRET="..."
```

✅ **Never Committed to Git**
- `.env` in `.gitignore`
- Keys only in memory
- No hardcoded secrets

✅ **Recommended Kraken Setup**
- Dedicated API key (separate from main account)
- Trading-only permissions (no withdraw)
- IP whitelist enabled
- Keys rotated monthly

---

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Paper Trading Phase (50+ trades)
- **Win Rate**: 50-65% (50%+ is baseline break-even after fees)
- **Profit Factor**: 1.3-2.0 (1.3 = 30% profit on winners)
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.5-2.5 (> 1 is good)
- **Confidence**: > 70% on main strategies
- **Edge**: > 0.8% per trade after fees

### Live Trading (after validation)
- Same metrics, but with real money
- Conservative leverage (1-2x)
- Small position sizes initially ($50-100)
- Gradual scaling as confidence grows
